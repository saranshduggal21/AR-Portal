# AR-Portal
This is an app that allows you to travel to any corner of the world via an AR Portal.

This app was made in Swift and uses an amalgamation of Apple's **ARKit & SceneKit** frameworks. 

Dynamic AR Models and Assets were made using **Blender**, **Google Blocks** and **XCode's Scene Editor**.
